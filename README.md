## How to use the map:
- Users can pan around the map and zoom in or out using their mouse or the buttons provided on the top left of your screen. Users can geolocate themselves using the pin button on the top left hand side. The measurement button just below the pin allows users to measure distances and areas. 
- Users of the map can toggle between different mining status types on the top left. By selecting a certain mining type the layer will be displayed. The order of the layers selected is important as the top selected layer will always be displayed on top of the layers below. You can also toggle on Google Satellite or Open Street Map basemaps for more detail. 
- To get more information on a specific mining concession zoom in to the desired concession and click on the concession. A popup will appear giving you information on the name, status, code, resource targeted and various other information. For more information on that mining application you can click the blue link in the pop up block.
